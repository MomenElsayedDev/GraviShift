## Elevator Pitch
Flip gravity, solve puzzles, and conquer challenging platformer levels in this unique 2D game.

---

## Inspiration
We wanted to create a platformer that challenges players’ perception of movement and physics. Traditional platformers only let you jump, but we thought, “What if gravity itself could be flipped?” The idea came from combining puzzle-solving with reflex-based gameplay to make a unique and engaging experience.

## What it does
GraviShift is a 2D platformer where players navigate through levels by flipping gravity. The goal is to collect coins, avoid obstacles, and reach the exit door. Each level introduces new challenges, requiring players to think creatively while reacting quickly. The final level rewards players with a satisfying visual and audio effect.

## How we built it
- **Language & Framework:** Python with the Arcade library for 2D game development.  
- **Core Mechanics:** Gravity flipping, collision detection, collectibles, and multiple levels.  
- **Assets:** Used Arcade’s built-in sprites for the player, tiles, and coins. Added custom audio for jumps, coin collection, and victories.  
- **UI:** Displayed score, instructions, and start/win screens with text overlays.

## Challenges we ran into
- **Physics Handling:** Implementing smooth gravity inversion without glitches.  
- **Level Design:** Creating challenging yet fair obstacles while keeping gameplay fun.  
- **Audio Management:** Looping music and playing different sounds for regular and final-level victories.  
- **Player Boundaries:** Preventing the player from moving outside the screen frame.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- Successfully implemented gravity-flipping mechanics.  
- Multiple levels with increasing difficulty and visual effects.  
- Differentiated sound cues for normal and final-level victories.  
- A polished start and win screen with score tracking and particle effects.

## What we learned
- How to use Arcade’s PhysicsEnginePlatformer effectively.  
- The importance of playtesting to ensure level difficulty is balanced.  
- Managing game states (start, game, win) to create a smooth user experience.  
- Audio integration for both background music and event-driven sounds.

## What's next for GraviShift: The Inversion Logic
- Add more levels with new mechanics and creative obstacles.  
- Introduce power-ups or collectibles that affect gravity or speed.  
- Improve visual design with custom sprites and animations.  
- Implement a leaderboard or scoring system for competitive play.
